# pitch2mocap
Tensorflow implementation of pix2pix for markerless motion capture. 

Similar to [Everybody Dance Now](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07371), we will attempt to perform pose transformations. Using side-view video of a pitcher, we will try to create a markerless motion capture of the piture using Pix2Pix/Pose2Pose.
